      <h3>Is PayWithMe free to use?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        Yes! You can create an event, invite members and start collecting money at no charge. Those who you are collecting from, however, are subject to small fees.
      </div>

      <h3>What are the small fees?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        PayWithMe adds a minimal charge to each transaction but does not charge the organizer. Fees are based on the payment facilitator. PayPal (2.9% + $0.30), WePay (2.9% + $0.30), and Dwolla ($0.25 on anything over $10) PayWithMe adds no fee on transactions under $10, a $0.50 fee under $30, a $1 fee under $50, and a $2 fee over $50 to keep our noses above the water.
