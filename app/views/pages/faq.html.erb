      <h3>Is PayWithMe free to use?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        Yes! You can create an event, invite members and start collecting money at no charge. Those who you are collecting from, however, are subject to small fees if they use an online payment processor.
      </div>

      <h3>Payment Processors?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        Payment processors are services such as PayPal, Dwolla and WePay. Fees for events are based on the payment processor used by the organizer. Both PayPal and WePay charge 2.9% + $0.30 on top of every transaction. Dwolla adds a $0.25 fee on top of every transaction greater than $10.
      </div>

      <h3>How does PayWithMe make money?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        PayWithMe adds a minimal charge to each transaction but does not charge the organizer. PayWithMe adds no fee on transactions under $10, a $0.50 fee under $30, a $1 fee under $50, and a $2 fee over $50 to keep our noses above the water.

      <h3>How do I change my timezone for events?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        Timezone settings can be found in your account settings. Eastern Time (US & Canada) is assumed as the default.

      <h3>I was sent a ticket. What is it, and what do I do with it?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        If the event organizer chooses the 'Send Tickets' option every user will be automatically emailed a custom ticket when they pay for the event. Each ticket has a custom QR code with specific information useful to the organizer. Expect the organizer to scan your ticket at the door to make sure you paid for the event.
