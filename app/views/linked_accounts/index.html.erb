      <h3>Where should your money go?</h3>
      <p>
        In order to collect money, unless you're doing exclusively cash payments, you will need a payment account. PayWithMe has three options for collecting electronic payments: <strong>WePay</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>, and <strong>Dwolla</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are unsure, here are a few tips on selecting which payment endpoint to use:
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you have a PayPal account or you think that some of your event members will have PayPal accounts, you should use <strong>PayPal</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a Dwolla account and you know that all of your event members use Dwolla, you should use <strong>Dwolla</strong>. Note that Dwolla requires you and all members to have Dwolla accounts. The advantage of Dwolla is much lower fees.
          </li>
          <li>
            Otherwise, you should use <strong>WePay</strong>. We will walk you through creating a WePay account. The above two platforms require you to have both a PayWithMe account and an account on the platform site. Once you get started with WePay, you will only need to use your PayWithMe account - you can completely forget that you're using WePay.
          </li>
        </ol>
